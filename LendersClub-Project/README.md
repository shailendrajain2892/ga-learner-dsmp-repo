### Project Overview

 In this project we will be exploring the publicly available data from LendingClub.com. Lending Club connects people who need money (borrowers) with people who have money (investors). As an investor one would want to invest in people who showed a profile of having a high probability of paying the amount back


### Learnings from the project

 I applied simple DecisionTree Classifier on this project and found if we do the hyperparameter tuning, we can get the better result.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 - Checked the data which was there in the dataset
- Analysed the box plot and count plot to find the mean and data distribution
- divided the dataset into numerical and categorical columns
- converted categorical columns to numerical one's using label encoding
- Applied Decision tree classifier without any hyper parameter tuning and checked the result
- Then applied hyper meter to see if acc can be better and found out it got better wiht min sample leaf and max depth limitation
